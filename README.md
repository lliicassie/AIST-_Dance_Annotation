Automatic annotation script for AIST++ dance corpus following the Functional Grammar of Dance.

This is created to release the heavy workload for humanities researchers in manual video annotation of human action (dance) on ELAN platform.

Technically, any dance video preprocessed and with accurate 3d skeleton keypoint and SMPL model format data can be annotated in this way.

The annotation file can be opened with ELAN platform for both qualitative and quantitative analysis for media/dance/communication studies.

I wrote this but I do not think it is a considerate method for dance video analysis.

For preprocessing, the accuracy of 3D human detection from single-view videos is currently not ideal, 

and I have not yet found an ideal visual cue detection model. 

At present, the script can only accurately annotate

3D human data extracted from calibrated multi-camera dance sequence (for example, AIST++).

I am looking forward to the future advancements in computer vision technology.

[A video preprocessing demo will be uploaded soon although it will not get very precise result
due to the limitation mentioned above.]


This script is freely available for academic research. If you require the annotation template file for the ELAN platform or have any questions,

feel free to contact me at ninomicass@gmail.com. I hope this tool proves helpful for anyone who is inerested in (hiphop )dance
